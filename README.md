# hello-world

This is my first step in learning to use GitHub!

My name's Ryan. I'm your average college student studying digital media and marketing with an emphasis in filmmaking. I've always been interested in coding and recently my job has required me to learn a little bit about it. The more I learn about coding and the more I learn about learning about coding, the more I think I could be happy doing it as a full-time career. The success stories are really inspiring and I can't wait to get into it more.
